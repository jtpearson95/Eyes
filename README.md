# Eyes Exercise

![eyes](https://github.com/jtpearson95/Eyes/assets/130475233/f6165700-f42c-4162-8ebb-766161215cb1)

In this project, we learned how to incorporate JavaScript, CSS, and HTML in order to create dynamic and stylistic elements. The exercise depicts two "eyes" with "pupils" that move in accordance with the cursor. In JavaScript, we utilized "getElementByClassName" as well as a for loop in order to get both eyes to shift around in equal duplication.

# How to Run:  
Download all documents and open the html file in your browser.

# Roadmap of future improvements: 
I'd like to try to play around and see if I can incorporate elements similar to the pacman exercise, where you can click to add randomly placed eyes with the same dynamic features.
